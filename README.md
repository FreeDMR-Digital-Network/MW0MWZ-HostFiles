## About These HostFiles

I mirror the official Pi-Star and other canonical hostfiles, etc. here, as to
prevent many users from slamming the official servers, while using my
unofficial Pi-Star fork
([<code>MW0MWZ-PiStar-Dash</code>](https://www.pistar.uk))  `;^)`

These hostfiles are checked for changes, and if there are changes, updated once
per hour at random minutes of each hour.

In the DMRIds.dat file, you will find the list of HamRadio and FreeDMR Amateurs Radio callsigns.

In the DMR_Hosts.txt file, you will find the list of German HamRadio + FreeDMR Amateurs Radio servers with the
setup for connection.
