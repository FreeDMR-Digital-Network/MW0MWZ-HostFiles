About These HostFiles

I mirror the official Pi-Star and other canonical hostfiles, etc. here, as to prevent many users from slamming the official servers, while using my unofficial Pi-Star fork (MW0MWZ-PiStar-Dash) ;^)

These hostfiles are checked for changes, and if there are changes, updated once per hour at random minutes of each hour.
